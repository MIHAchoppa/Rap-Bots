## Clone System

### Overview
The Clone System allows users to create AI clones of themselves that match their rap battle skill level. Users can battle against their clone for practice and skill improvement.

### Features
- **Automatic Skill Analysis**: Analyzes user's past battles (up to 10 recent) to determine skill metrics
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Clone difficulty automatically adjusts based on user's skill level
- **Detailed Metrics**: Tracks overall skill, rhyme density, flow quality, and creativity
- **Battle Style Detection**: Identifies user's battle style (technical, smooth, creative, balanced)

### Database Schema
```typescript
userClones table:
- id: UUID (primary key)
- userId: UUID (foreign key to users)
- cloneName: string
- skillLevel: integer (0-100)
- avgRhymeDensity: integer (0-100)
- avgFlowQuality: integer (0-100)
- avgCreativity: integer (0-100)
- battlesAnalyzed: integer
- style: text (battle style)
- voiceId: text (TTS voice)
- isActive: boolean
- createdAt: timestamp
- updatedAt: timestamp
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/user/clone` - Fetch user's clone
- `POST /api/user/clone/generate` - Generate or update clone
- `GET /api/clone/:cloneId` - Fetch clone by ID

### Usage

2. Click "Generate My Clone" to create your first clone
3. Click "Battle Your Clone" to start a practice battle
4. Click "Update Clone" to regenerate based on recent performance

### Skill Level Mapping
- **< 40**: Easy difficulty
- **40-64**: Normal difficulty
- **65-84**: Hard difficulty
- **â‰¥ 85**: Nightmare difficulty

## Technical Implementation Details

### Clone Generation Algorithm
1. Fetch user's last 10 battles
2. Calculate average scores:
   - Rhyme density
   - Flow quality
   - Creativity
   - Overall performance
3. Determine battle style based on score patterns
4. Generate clone name
5. Assign appropriate voice ID
6. Store in database

### Fine-Tuning Flow
1. User provides training data
2. Convert to JSONL format
3. Upload to Groq file storage
4. Create fine-tuning job with file ID
5. Monitor job status
6. Return fine-tuned model ID when complete

### SEO Component Architecture
- React component with useEffect hooks
- Dynamic DOM manipulation for meta tags
- Canonical URL calculation
- Structured data injection
- Location-aware URL generation

---

## Security Considerations

### Clone System
- User can only access their own clone
- Clone IDs are UUIDs to prevent enumeration
- Authentication required for all clone endpoints

### Training System
- API key required for fine-tuning operations
- Training data is validated before upload
- File size limits enforced (via multer)
- User-specific model isolation

### SEO
- No sensitive data in meta tags
- Canonical URLs prevent duplicate content
- Robots.txt blocks admin/API routes
- XSS protection via React's built-in escaping

---

## Troubleshooting

### Clone Not Generating
- **Issue**: No clone found after generation
- **Solution**: Ensure user has completed at least one battle
- **Fallback**: Default clone created with skill level 50

### Fine-Tuning Access Denied
- **Issue**: "Fine-tuning is in closed beta" message
- **Solution**: Contact Groq support for API access
- **Workaround**: Use existing models or sample data

### SEO Not Updating
- **Issue**: Meta tags not changing on page navigation
- **Solution**: SEO component uses useEffect with proper dependencies
- **Check**: Browser cache may need clearing for OG images

---

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Clone vs Clone battles (user's clone vs another user's clone)
- [ ] Custom clone names and avatars
- [ ] Clone training mode (adjust specific skills)
- [ ] Clone leaderboards
- [ ] Share your clone with friends

### Training System
- [ ] Multi-file training data upload
- [ ] Training progress visualization
- [ ] Model performance analytics
- [ ] A/B testing between models
- [ ] Community model sharing

### SEO
- [ ] Dynamic sitemap generation from database
- [ ] RSS feed for tournament results
- [ ] AMP pages for mobile
- [ ] Video schema for embedded content
- [ ] FAQ schema for help pages
