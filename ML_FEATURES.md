# Machine Learning Features for Rapper Cloning

This document explains how Rap Bots uses machine learning to clone rappers by combining voice synthesis, style transfer, and lyric generation models.

## üé§ Overview

Rap Bots implements a comprehensive ML pipeline that mimics vocal tone, flow, and lyrical style using:

1. **Voice Cloning** - Text-to-Speech with rapper-style voices
2. **Lyric Style Transfer** - LLM-based lyric generation matching specific rapper styles  
3. **Beat Alignment** - Flow modeling that syncs lyrics to beats
4. **Prosody Modeling** - Syllable stress and timing for authentic delivery

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### 1. Voice Cloning System

The platform supports multiple TTS providers for voice synthesis:

#### **Typecast AI** (Primary)
- **Path**: `server/services/typecast.ts`
- **Features**: Pre-built rapper voices with emotion controls
- **Models**: `ssfm-v21` advanced model for high quality
- **Configuration**: Emotion presets (confident, aggressive, etc.)
- **Usage**: Default TTS provider for rap battles

#### **ElevenLabs** (Premium)
- **Path**: `server/services/elevenlabs-tts.ts`
- **Features**: High-quality voice cloning with style customization
- **Models**: Turbo models for real-time battles
- **Configuration**: Voice styles (aggressive, confident, smooth, intense, playful)
- **Usage**: Premium users can access higher quality voices

#### **Groq TTS** (Fast Inference)
- **Path**: `server/services/groq-tts.ts`
- **Features**: Fast voice synthesis for quick battles
- **Usage**: Fallback option for high-speed inference

### 2. Lyric Style Transfer

Uses transformer-based LLMs to generate lyrics matching specific rapper styles:

#### **Groq LLaMA Integration**
- **Path**: `server/services/groq.ts`
- **Model**: LLaMA 3.1 70B (fast inference via Groq API)
- **Technique**: Prompt engineering with rapper-specific style guidelines

**Example Style Prompt**:
```
Write a 16-bar verse in the style of Kendrick Lamar, known for complex 
multi-syllable rhyme schemes, intricate wordplay, and precise flow.

Style Guidelines:
- Use approximately 14 syllables per bar
- Rhyme complexity: HIGH - use multi-syllable and internal rhymes
- Flow variation: VARIED - change up rhythm and pace
- Include clever wordplay, double entendres, and punch lines
- Use rich metaphors and vivid imagery

Theme: social justice and internal struggle
Generate ONLY the lyrics, no explanations.
```

#### **Rapper Profile System**
- **Path**: `server/services/ml-rapper-cloning.ts`
- **Features**: Analyze user's battle history to create personalized style profiles
- **Characteristics Tracked**:
  - Average syllables per bar
  - Rhyme complexity (0-1 scale)
  - Flow variation (0-1 scale)  
  - Wordplay frequency (0-1 scale)
  - Metaphor density (0-1 scale)
  - Common battle tactics

### 3. Beat Alignment & Flow Modeling

Syncs lyrics with beats using tempo detection and prosody modeling:

#### **Beat Tracking**
- **BPM Detection**: Calculates milliseconds per bar based on tempo
- **Time Signature**: Supports 4/4 time (standard for rap)
- **Downbeat Detection**: Identifies strong beats for emphasis placement

#### **Prosody Modeling**
The system models natural speech patterns for rap delivery:

- **Syllable Stress**: Assigns stress levels (0-1) to each syllable
  - Higher stress on rhyming words
  - Natural emphasis on first and penultimate syllables in multi-syllable words
  - Reduced stress on filler words

- **Pause Points**: Identifies breath points between lines
  - End of each line gets 15% of bar duration for breathing
  - Micro-pauses between words (10% of syllable duration)

- **Timing Distribution**: Maps each syllable to precise timestamps
  - Equal distribution of syllables across bar duration
  - Adjusts for natural speech flow

**Algorithm**:
```typescript
const msPerBar = (60000 / bpm) * 4; // 4 beats per bar
const timePerSyllable = msPerBar / syllablesInLine;

// Stress pattern
const stress = isRhyme ? 0.8 : 0.5;
const naturalStress = isSyllableStart ? stress * 1.2 : stress * 0.8;
```

### 4. Lyric Analysis Engine

Advanced analysis for understanding rap style:

- **Path**: `server/services/lyricAnalysis.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Phonetic rhyme detection
  - Internal rhyme identification
  - Multi-syllable rhyme tracking
  - Wordplay detection
  - Metaphor identification
  - Battle tactics recognition
  - Lexical diversity calculation

## üéØ Use Cases

### 1. Clone Your Own Style

Generate a rapper profile from your battle history:

```typescript
import { mlRapperCloningService } from './server/services/ml-rapper-cloning';

// Analyze user's battles to create profile
const profile = await mlRapperCloningService.createProfileFromHistory(
  userId,
  userBattles
);

// Generate new lyrics in user's style
const lyrics = await mlRapperCloningService.generateStyledLyrics({
  prompt: "Write a battle verse",
  targetRapper: "User Clone",
  rapperProfile: profile,
  bars: 16,
  theme: "proving skills",
  opponentName: "Competitor"
});
```

### 2. Clone Famous Rapper Styles

Create verses mimicking specific rapper styles:

```typescript
const kendrickProfile: RapperProfile = {
  name: "Kendrick Lamar",
  style: "technical",
  characteristics: {
    avgSyllablesPerBar: 14,
    rhymeComplexity: 0.9,
    flowVariation: 0.8,
    wordplayFrequency: 0.8,
    metaphorDensity: 0.9,
    battleTactics: ["social commentary", "personal narrative", "complex schemes"]
  }
};

const verse = await mlRapperCloningService.generateStyledLyrics({
  rapperProfile: kendrickProfile,
  bars: 16,
  theme: "perseverance"
});
```

### 3. Beat-Aligned Voice Synthesis

Generate voice with proper timing:

```typescript
const beatContext: BeatContext = {
  bpm: 90,
  timeSignature: "4/4",
  genre: "boom-bap"
};

const result = await mlRapperCloningService.cloneVoice({
  text: lyrics,
  rapperProfile: profile,
  beatContext,
  provider: 'elevenlabs'
});

// result.flowModeling contains precise timing for each syllable
```
