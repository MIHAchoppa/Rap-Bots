### 2. Google AdSense Setup

#### Apply for AdSense
1. Go to [adsense.google.com](https://www.google.com/adsense)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Submit your website for review
4. Wait for approval (1-2 weeks typically)

#### Get Your Publisher ID
Once approved:
1. Log in to AdSense Dashboard
2. Go to **Account** ‚Üí **Account information**
3. Copy your **Publisher ID** (looks like `ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`)

#### Configure Environment Variable
```bash
# Add to your .env file
VITE_ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID=ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

#### Update HTML
The AdSense script is already added to `client/index.html`. Just update the client ID:
```html
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"></script>
```

#### Create Ad Units
1. In AdSense Dashboard, go to **Ads** ‚Üí **Overview**
2. Click **By ad unit**
3. Create the following ad units:
   - **Home Banner**: Display ad, Responsive
   - **Battle Interstitial**: Display ad, Full screen
   - **Rewarded Video**: Rewarded video ad
4. Copy the **Ad Slot IDs** for each unit

#### Update Ad Components
In your code, update the slot IDs:
```tsx
// In Home.tsx
<AdBanner slot="YOUR_HOME_BANNER_SLOT_ID" />

// In battle-arena.tsx
<InterstitialAd /> // Uses default slot
```

### 3. CashApp Setup (Optional)

#### Set Up CashApp
1. Download CashApp mobile app
2. Create a business account or use personal
3. Your CashApp tag (e.g., `$ILLAITHEGPTSTORE`)

The CashApp integration is already configured in the code to use `$ILLAITHEGPTSTORE`. Update if needed:
```typescript
// In server/routes.ts
metadata: {
  ...(paymentMethod === 'cashapp' && { cashapp_account: '$YOURCASHTAG' })
}
```

---

### 4. Database Migration

Run the database migration to ensure all monetization tables exist:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

This creates/updates:
- `users` table with subscription fields
- `processedWebhookEvents` table for idempotency
- `userClones` table for clone battles

---

## üß™ Testing

### Test Subscriptions

#### Test Cards (Stripe)
Use these test cards in test mode:
- **Success**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Decline**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- **3D Secure**: `4000 0025 0000 3155`

Any future expiry date and any 3-digit CVC works.

#### Test Flow
1. Go to `/subscribe?tier=premium`
2. Enter test card details
3. Complete payment
4. Verify webhook processes correctly
5. Check user subscription status updates

### Test Battle Packs

1. Go to home page when out of battles
2. Click "Buy Battles"
3. Select pack (10 or 1500 battles)
4. Complete payment with test card
5. Verify battles added to account

### Test Ads

#### Local Testing (Without AdSense)
The ad components work in "demo mode" without real AdSense:
- Banner ads show placeholder
- Rewarded videos simulate 3-second playback
- Interstitial ads show countdown

#### With AdSense (Production)
1. Deploy to production domain
2. Ensure AdSense is approved for your domain
3. Test with actual ad units
4. Monitor AdSense dashboard for impressions

### Test Clone Battles

1. Create a clone: Go to `/clone`
2. Generate clone (analyzes your battles)
3. Battle your clone
4. Verify clone sponsorship shows (if configured)
