[Verse]
The final problem is solved by throwin' sulfuric acid all over your back to see your spinal column dissolve
Droppin' bodies like it was domino season
My phenomenal legion will shoot out
Your fuckin' abdominal region
Slim Shady, responsible for your permanent stillness
Just escaped from the hospital with terminal illness
Itchin' to rip your fuckin' frame out
'Cause I ain't got nothing to lose
Like that movie that just came out
Callin' your name out, first, last and your middle initial
Your mom, your dad, and your pregnant widow will miss you
And anybody else poppin' some shit'll go with you
'Cause I ain't tryna hear it like a political issue
So until I can leave with enough funds
I'mma shove guns up in the mouths of your loved ones
Drown 'em face down in the bath while the tub runs
Got a rap sheet that's longer than Tubby's sub buns

Part II

[Verse]
And I'ma kill it, just so y'all think that I can't come off the top
And I'll be forced to rock unorthodox styles from off the top of the dome with a popular poem
Forget a damn team, I can stop you alone
Rappers thinkin' they puttin' out they records 'cause they sell
But they can't't fuck with what meâ€“ we doin' here with A.L
Y'all don't wanna do it when we kick it
When we kick the fluid, rappers don't wanna get into it
Y'all knew it 'cause the feds want me
They headhunt me, I'm Ted Bundy
"I ain't dead, I just fled country"
Said bluntly, a cannibal, animal, fed monthly
Eating bread crunchy, cement bed's comfy
Head's lumpy, funky like a dead skunk be
Med flunkie, jump off cliffs with thread bungie
Wearin' red undies and a black cape
Rollin' through the hood cracked out bumpin' your whack tape
I'm comin' through dumpin'
Change your rap name to Richard Jewell
Cause you ain't blowing up nothing
I'm showin' up puffin'
Throwin' up, drinkin'
Killin' braincells 'til I'm slow and not thinkin'
Growin' up stinkin', born with bad odor
Give me Hennessy, but please don't add soda
Now who's doper? You couldn't beat me when I'm sober
I'm off my fuckin' rocker like your grandma tippin' over, Slim Shady
