Learn how to make your first ElevenLabs API request.
The ElevenLabs API provides a simple interface to state-of-the-art audio models and features. Follow this guide to learn how to create lifelike speech with our Text to Speech API. See the developer guides for more examples with our other products.

Using the Text to Speech API
1
Create an API key
Create an API key in the dashboard here, which you’ll use to securely access the API.

Store the key as a managed secret and pass it to the SDKs either as a environment variable via an .env file, or directly in your app’s configuration depending on your preference.

.env

ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=<your_api_key_here>
2
Install the SDK
We’ll also use the dotenv library to load our API key from an environment variable.


Python

TypeScript

pip install elevenlabs
pip install python-dotenv
To play the audio through your speakers, you may be prompted to install MPV and/or ffmpeg.

3
Make your first request
Create a new file named example.py or example.mts, depending on your language of choice and add the following code:


Python

TypeScript

from dotenv import load_dotenv
from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs
from elevenlabs import play
import os
load_dotenv()
elevenlabs = ElevenLabs(
  api_key=os.getenv("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"),
)
audio = elevenlabs.text_to_speech.convert(
    text="The first move is what sets everything in motion.",
    voice_id="JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb",
    model_id="eleven_multilingual_v2",
    output_format="mp3_44100_128",
)
play(audio)
4
Run the code

Python

TypeScript

python example.py
You should hear the audio play through your speakers.
