At the pinnacle of this evolution stands a small group of artists who have mastered the science of lyrical construction to such a degree that their work seems almost superhuman in its complexity. This book is not about writing "good" rap lyrics. There are plenty of resources for that. This is about understanding and mastering the specific technical mechanisms that separate elite-level rappers from everyone else. It's about the difference between someone who can rap well and someone who can construct verses with the mathematical precision and artistic beauty of a master architect. The techniques in this book are based on detailed analysis of the most technically proficient rappers in history, with particular focus on artists like Eminem, whose consistency in applying complex techniques across multiple albums represents the gold standard of technical rap mastery. Whether you're an aspiring rapper, a songwriter looking to understand advanced techniques, or simply a hip-hop fan curious about the mechanics behind your favorite verses, this book will give you the tools to understand, analyze, and create rap lyrics at the highest possible level. PART I: FOUNDATIONS Chapter 1: The Science of Sound The Fundamental Principle Before we dive into complex rhyme schemes and pattern layering, we must establish the most important principle in advanced rap construction: sound trumps spelling. This principle forms the foundation of everything that follows. Consider these two words: "orange" and "door hinge." On paper, they share no letters in common. To the eye, they couldn't be more different. But to the ear—the only judge that matters in rap—they are nearly identical: Orange: /ˈɔrɪndʒ/ Door hinge: /dɔr hɪndʒ/ This is not a clever trick or wordplay gimmick. This is the fundamental operating principle of elite-level rap construction. Every technique in this book builds from this core understanding: we are working with sounds, not letters. The Phonetic Foundation To master advanced rap techniques, you must train your ear to hear sounds independent of their written representation. This requires understanding the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and developing what we call "phonetic hearing"—the ability to break down any word into its component sounds. Exercise 1.1: Phonetic Deconstruction Take the following common rap rhymes and write out their phonetic representations: Cat /kæt/ - Hat /hæt/ - Bat /bæt/ Flow /floʊ/ - Show /ʃoʊ/ - Grow /groʊ/ Right /raɪt/ - Night /naɪt/ - Fight /faɪt/ Notice how the phonetic representations reveal the exact sound patterns that make these words rhyme. This is your foundation. Sound Families and Phonetic Relationships Once you understand that we're working with sounds, you can begin to see relationships between words that would never be apparent from their spelling. Consider this sound family: /ɪ/ vowel family: Rich /rɪtʃ/ Wish /wɪʃ/ Fist /fɪst/ Lift /lɪft/ Quick /kwɪk/ Thick /θɪk/ All of these words share the same core vowel sound, making them part of the same phonetic family. Elite rappers build their rhyme schemes by thinking in terms of these sound families rather than traditional spelling-based rhymes. The Hierarchy of Rhyme Quality Not all rhymes are created equal. Understanding the hierarchy of rhyme quality is crucial for building sophisticated patterns: Tier 1: Perfect Rhymes Identical vowel sounds Identical consonant sounds after the vowel Different consonant sounds before the vowel Example: Cat /kæt/ - Hat /hæt/ Tier 2: Family Rhymes Identical vowel sounds Related consonant sounds after the vowel Different consonant sounds before the vowel Example: Rich /rɪtʃ/ - Wish /wɪʃ/ Tier 3: Assonance Identical vowel sounds Different consonant sounds Example: Cat /kæt/ - Trap /træp/ Tier 4: Consonance Different vowel sounds Identical consonant sounds Example: Cat /kæt/ - Cut /kʌt/ Elite rappers use all four tiers strategically, with perfect and family rhymes forming the backbone of their patterns, while assonance and consonance provide texture and complexity. Building Your Phonetic Vocabulary To work at an elite level, you need to build a mental database of sound families. This isn't about memorizing lists—it's about training your ear to automatically categorize sounds as you hear them. Exercise 1.2: Sound Family Construction For each of the following vowel sounds, list 10 words that contain that sound: /eɪ/ (as in "day") /aɪ/ (as in "night") /oʊ/ (as in "flow") /ɪ/ (as in "rich") /æ/ (as in "cat") Don't worry about spelling. Focus purely on the sound. Words like "weigh," "way," and "day" all belong in the /eɪ/ family despite their different spellings. The Cognitive Shift Mastering this foundational principle requires a cognitive shift. You must train yourself to hear language differently than you've been conditioned to since childhood. When you hear the word "compliments," your brain should automatically categorize it with "confidence," "consequence," and "providence"—not because they look similar, but because they sound similar. This shift is not optional for elite-level work. It's the difference between someone who can occasionally create clever rhymes and someone who can construct verses with 70%+ rhyme density while maintaining meaning and flow. Chapter 2: Understanding Phonetics in Rap The Rapper's Phonetic System While linguists use the International Phonetic Alphabet for precision, rappers need a more intuitive system that can be applied in real-time during the creative process. This chapter develops a practical phonetic system specifically designed for rap construction. Core Vowel Sounds in American English Rap American rap is built around approximately 15 core vowel sounds. Mastering these sounds and their relationships is essential for advanced pattern construction: The Long Vowels: /eɪ/ - "day, way, say, play" /aɪ/ - "night, right, fight, sight" /oɪ/ - "boy, toy, joy, destroy" /aʊ/ - "now, how, wow, allow" /oʊ/ - "flow, show, grow, know" The Short Vowels: 6. /ɪ/ - "rich, wish, quick, thick" 7. /ɛ/ - "red, bed, said, dead" 8. /æ/ - "cat, hat, trap, rap" 9. /ʌ/ - "cut, but, tough, rough" 10. /ʊ/ - "book, look, took, good" The Complex Vowels: 11. /i/ - "see, free, be, key" 12. /ɑ/ - "hot, got, not, shot" 13. /ɔ/ - "law, saw, raw, draw" 14. /u/ - "cool, fool, tool, school" 15. /ə/ - "about, around, alone" (the schwa) Consonant Families and Relationships Consonants in rap work differently than in traditional poetry. Rappers regularly use consonant families—groups of sounds that are phonetically related—to expand their rhyming possibilities. Stop Consonants (Hard Sounds): /p/, /b/ - "pop, bob, top, rob" /t/, /d/ - "cat, bad, hit, red" /k/, /g/ - "back, bag, sick, big" Fricative Consonants (Soft Sounds): /f/, /v/ - "rough, love, tough, above" /s/, /z/ - "miss, his, pass, jazz" /ʃ/, /ʒ/ - "wish, vision, cash, measure" Nasal Consonants: /m/, /n/, /ŋ/ - "him, thin, ring" Understanding these relationships allows you to create family rhymes that expand your options exponentially. For example, if you're rhyming with "cat" /kæt/, you can use not only perfect rhymes like "hat" /hæt/, but also family rhymes like "cap" /kæp/ or "cash" /kæʃ/. Multi-Syllable Phonetic Patterns Elite rap construction often involves matching phonetic patterns across multiple syllables. This requires understanding how syllables combine to create larger sound units. Two-Syllable Patterns: "Better" /ˈbɛtər/ matches with "letter" /ˈlɛtər/ "Money" /ˈmʌni/ matches with "honey" /ˈhʌni/ "Crazy" /ˈkreɪzi/ matches with "lazy" /ˈleɪzi/ Three-Syllable Patterns: "Definitely" /ˈdɛfənətli/ matches with "referee" /ˌrɛfəˈri/ "Compliments" /ˈkɑmpləmənts/ matches with "confidence" /ˈkɑnfɪdəns/ "Ability" /əˈbɪləti/ matches with "facility" /fəˈsɪləti/ Cross-Word Phonetic Matching One of the most powerful techniques in elite rap is matching phonetic patterns across word boundaries. This allows you to rhyme phrases with single words, dramatically expanding your creative possibilities. Examples: "I can see" /aɪ kæn si/ matches with "try and be" /traɪ ænd bi/ "Give me the" /gɪv mi ðə/ matches with "Timothy" /ˈtɪməθi/ "Living off" /ˈlɪvɪŋ ɔf/ matches with "criminal" /ˈkrɪmənəl/ (family rhyme) Phonetic Stress Patterns In multi-syllable rhyming, stress patterns are as important as the sounds themselves. English has predictable stress patterns that elite rappers exploit for maximum effect. Primary Stress Patterns: First syllable: "MO-ney, HO-ney, FUN-ny" Second syllable: "a-BOUT, a-ROUND, a-LONE" Third syllable: "un-der-STAND, re-pre-SENT" When matching multi-syllable rhymes, the stress patterns should align: "DEF-i-nite-ly" matches with "REF-e-ree" (both start with primary stress) "a-BIL-i-ty" matches with "fa-CIL-i-ty" (both have second-syllable stress) Practical Phonetic Training Developing elite-level phonetic hearing requires systematic training. Here are the essential exercises: Exercise 2.1: Vowel Sound Isolation Listen to rap verses and identify the core vowel sound in each rhyming word. Don't look at the lyrics—train your ear to categorize sounds automatically. Exercise 2.2: Consonant Family Recognition Practice identifying consonant families in real-time. When you hear a word ending in /t/, immediately think of related sounds like /d/, /k/, and /g/. Exercise 2.3: Multi-Syllable Pattern Matching Take complex multi-syllable words and find phonetic matches. Start with three-syllable words and work your way up to five or six syllables. Exercise 2.4: Cross-Word Boundary Practice Practice breaking phrases into phonetic components and matching them with single words or other phrases. Common Phonetic Mistakes Even advanced rappers make phonetic mistakes that limit their effectiveness: Mistake 1: Visual Bias Choosing rhymes based on spelling rather than sound. "Love" and "move" look like they should rhyme but sound completely different. Mistake 2: Stress Mismatch Matching sounds but ignoring stress patterns, creating awkward rhythmic flow. Mistake 3: Over-Forcing Family Rhymes Using family rhymes that are too distant phonetically, making the connection unclear to listeners. Mistake 4: Ignoring Regional Pronunciation Not accounting for how different pronunciations affect rhyme schemes in different regions. Building Your Phonetic Database Elite rappers maintain mental databases of phonetic patterns that they can access instantly during the creative process. Building this database requires systematic practice: Daily Phonetic Practice: Spend 15 minutes daily categorizing words by vowel sounds Practice identifying consonant families in everyday speech Break down complex words into phonetic components Match multi-syllable patterns across different words Phonetic Pattern Journal: Keep a notebook of interesting phonetic patterns you discover. Organize by: Vowel sound families Consonant relationships Multi-syllable patterns Cross-word boundary matches This foundation in practical phonetics is essential for everything that follows. Without it, the advanced techniques in later chapters will be impossible to execute consistently. Chapter 3: Perfect vs. Family Rhymes Defining the Spectrum The distinction between perfect and family rhymes is crucial for understanding how elite rappers construct their verses. This isn't just an academic exercise—it's the difference between having a limited set of rhyming options and having virtually unlimited creative possibilities. Perfect Rhymes: The Foundation Perfect rhymes are the gold standard of traditional poetry and the backbone of rap construction. They provide the strongest sonic connections and create the most satisfying resolution for listeners. Perfect Rhyme Requirements: Identical vowel sounds in the stressed syllable Identical consonant sounds following the vowel (if any) Different consonant sounds preceding the vowel Classic Perfect Rhyme Examples: Cat /kæt/ - Hat /hæt/ - Bat /bæt/ Flow /floʊ/ - Show /ʃoʊ/ - Grow /groʊ/ Right /raɪt/ - Night /naɪt/ - Fight /faɪt/ The Limitation Problem While perfect rhymes provide the strongest connections, they also create significant limitations. English has a finite number of perfect rhymes for any given word, and many words have very few perfect rhyming partners. Consider the word "orange." In traditional poetry, this word is considered "unrhymable" because it has no perfect rhymes in English. This limitation has frustrated poets for centuries and would severely restrict rap construction if we relied solely on perfect rhymes. Family Rhymes: Expanding the Possibilities Family rhymes solve the limitation problem by expanding the definition of what constitutes a rhyme. They maintain the essential sonic connection while providing vastly more options for creative expression. Family Rhyme Definition: Family rhymes share the same vowel sound but have related (rather than identical) consonant sounds following the vowel. Consonant Relationship Categories: 1. Voiced/Unvoiced Pairs: /p/ and /b/: "cap" /kæp/ - "cab" /kæb/ /t/ and /d/: "cat" /kæt/ - "bad" /bæd/ /k/ and /g/: "back" /bæk/ - "bag" /bæg/ 2. Same Manner of Articulation: Stops: /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/, /g/ Fricatives: /f/, /v/, /s/, /z/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/ Nasals: /m/, /n/, /ŋ/ 3. Same Place of Articulation: Labial: /p/, /b/, /m/ Alveolar: /t/, /d/, /n/, /s/, /z/ Velar: /k/, /g/, /ŋ/ Practical Family Rhyme Construction Understanding the theory is only the first step. Elite rappers need to be able to construct family rhyme groups instantly during the creative process. Exercise 3.1: Building Family Rhyme Groups Start with the word "rich" /rɪtʃ/ and build a family rhyme group: Perfect rhymes: witch, ditch, pitch, switch Family rhymes: wish /rɪʃ/ (fricative family) fist /rɪst/ (different consonant cluster) lift /rɪft/ (different consonant cluster) quick /kwɪk/ (stop consonant family) This single word now has dozens of rhyming partners instead of just four. Multi-Syllable Family Rhymes The real power of family rhymes becomes apparent in multi-syllable constructions. Consider the Drake example from Steven Bruno's analysis: Perfect rhymes: Compliments /ˈkɑmpləmənts/ Confidence /ˈkɑnfɪdəns/ Family rhymes: Consequence /ˈkɑnsəkwəns/ Providence /ˈprɑvɪdəns/ Prominence /ˈprɑmənəns/ Accomplishments /əˈkɑmplɪʃmənts/ Consciousness /ˈkɑnʃəsnəs/ Notice how the family rhymes maintain the essential /ɑn...əns/ pattern while varying the middle consonants and the final consonant sounds. The Eminem Approach to Family Rhymes Eminem's mastery of family rhymes is one of the key factors in his technical superiority. He uses family rhymes not as substitutes for perfect rhymes, but as tools for creating more complex and interesting patterns. Example from "Bitch Please II": "Criminal" /ˈkrɪmənəl/ "Living off" /ˈlɪvɪŋ ɔf/ These are family rhymes based on the shared /ɪ/ vowel sound and similar consonant patterns. The connection is subtle but audible, adding texture to the verse without disrupting the flow. Strategic Use of Perfect vs. Family Rhymes Elite rappers don't choose between perfect and family rhymes—they use both strategically within the same verse. Strategic Applications: Perfect rhymes for: Strong pattern endings Hook/chorus construction Emphasis and resolution Clear sonic connections Family rhymes for: Pattern variation Increased vocabulary options Subtle connections Complex layering Quality Control in Family Rhymes Not all family rhymes are created equal. Some connections are strong and clear, while others are too distant to be effective. Developing quality control is essential for maintaining professional standards. Strong Family Rhymes: Rich /rɪtʃ/ - Wish /rɪʃ/ (clear fricative relationship) Cat /kæt/ - Cap /kæp/ (clear stop consonant relationship) Weak Family Rhymes: Rich /rɪtʃ/ - Ring /rɪŋ/ (too distant consonant relationship) Cat /kæt/ - Can /kæn/ (nasal connection too weak) Quality Control Guidelines: The vowel sound must be identical The consonant relationship must be clear and audible The connection should enhance rather than distract from the flow Family rhymes should support, not replace, perfect rhymes Advanced Family Rhyme Techniques Once you've mastered basic family rhyme construction, you can begin using advanced techniques that separate elite rappers from intermediate ones. Technique 1: Graduated Family Rhymes Create chains of family rhymes that gradually move away from the original sound: Rich /rɪtʃ/ → Wish /rɪʃ/ → Fist /rɪst/ → Lift /rɪft/ Technique 2: Cross-Pattern Family Rhymes Use family rhymes to connect different rhyme patterns within the same verse: Pattern A: Rich, wish, fist Pattern B: Quick, thick, sick Connection: Both patterns share the /ɪ/ vowel sound Technique 3: Compound Family Rhymes Create family rhymes using multiple words: "Rich kid" /rɪtʃ kɪd/ - "Quick wit" /kwɪk wɪt/ Practice Regimen for Family Rhymes Mastering family rhymes requires systematic practice. Here's a progressive training program: Week 1: Single-Syllable Family Rhymes Practice building family rhyme groups for common words Focus on consonant relationships Aim for 10 family rhymes per base word Week 2: Multi-Syllable Family Rhymes Work with two and three-syllable words Practice maintaining stress patterns Focus on clear sonic connections Week 3: Strategic Integration Practice mixing perfect and family rhymes in verses Focus on using family rhymes for variation Maintain quality control standards Week 4: Advanced Applications Practice graduated family rhyme chains Work on cross-pattern connections Experiment with compound family rhymes Common Family Rhyme Mistakes Even experienced rappers make mistakes with family rhymes that can weaken their verses: Mistake 1: Over-Reliance Using too many family rhymes without enough perfect rhymes for anchoring. Mistake 2: Weak Connections Using family rhymes where the consonant relationship is too distant to be audible. Mistake 3: Inconsistent Quality Mixing strong and weak family rhymes within the same pattern. Mistake 4: Ignoring Context Using family rhymes that work phonetically but don't fit the song's style or mood. The Creative Advantage Mastering family rhymes provides a massive creative advantage. Instead of being limited to the handful of perfect rhymes for any given word, you have access to dozens or even hundreds of rhyming options. This freedom allows for: More natural word choices Better storytelling flow Increased vocabulary diversity More complex pattern construction Greater creative expression The difference between a rapper who only uses perfect rhymes and one who has mastered family rhymes is the difference between painting with a few colors and painting with a full palette. Both can create art, but only one has the tools for true mastery. PART II: BASIC CONSTRUCTION Chapter 4: Single-Pattern Rhyming The Foundation of All Rap Construction Before diving into the complex multi-pattern techniques that define elite rap, you must master single-pattern rhyming. This is not "basic" in the sense of being simple or unimportant—it's foundational in the sense of being the building block upon which all advanced techniques are constructed. Single-pattern rhyming is like learning to walk before you run. Every technique in this book builds from the principles established in this chapter. Master these concepts completely before moving forward. Understanding Pattern Structure A rhyme pattern is a systematic arrangement of rhyming sounds throughout a verse or section. In single-pattern rhyming, you maintain one consistent rhyming sound throughout a defined section of lyrics. Basic Pattern Structure: code Line 1: Word ending in sound A Line 2: Word ending in sound A Line 3: Word ending in sound A Line 4: Word ending in sound A Example: code I write these bars with skill and might (A) Working through the day and night (A) My flow is clean, my words are tight (A) Step to me, prepare to fight (A) The Five Levels of Single-Pattern Complexity Single-pattern rhyming exists on a spectrum of complexity. Understanding these levels allows you to choose the appropriate level for your artistic goals and gradually build toward more advanced techniques. Level 1: Simple End Rhymes The most basic form, where only the final word of each line rhymes: code I'm spitting fire from the booth My lyrics always speak the truth My style is smooth, my flow is proof That I'm the best, that's what I do Level 2: Two-Syllable End Rhymes The final two syllables of each line rhyme: code I'm getting better every day My skills will never fade away I'm here to stay, I'm here to play Success is coming, that's my way Level 3: Internal Single Rhymes One internal rhyme plus the end rhyme: code I WRITE these TIGHT verses with MIGHT Every WORD you HEARD is PREFERRED and RIGHT My FLOW will SHOW what I KNOW is BRIGHT These BARS are STARS, they SCAR and FIGHT Level 4: Multiple Internal Rhymes Multiple internal rhymes plus the end rhyme: code I WRITE these TIGHT verses with SKILL and MIGHT Every WORD you HEARD is PREFERRED, it's RIGHT My FLOW will SHOW what I KNOW, so BRIGHT These BARS are STARS, they SCAR and FIGHT Level 5: Maximum Density Nearly every syllable participates in the rhyme scheme: code I WRITE these TIGHT verses with SKILL and MIGHT tonight Every WORD you HEARD is PREFERRED, it's RIGHT and BRIGHT My FLOW will SHOW what I KNOW, so BRIGHT it's SIGHT These BARS are STARS, they SCAR and FIGHT with LIGHT Rhyme Placement Strategies Where you place your rhymes within each line is as important as the rhymes themselves. Different placement strategies create different effects and serve different purposes. End-Heavy Placement: Concentrates rhymes at the end of lines for strong resolution: code I'm working hard to reach my GOAL Music is what feeds my SOUL I'm in control, I play my ROLE Success is what I'm living FOR Front-Heavy Placement: Concentrates rhymes at the beginning for strong momentum: code BRIGHT lights shine on my SIGHT NIGHT time brings me pure DELIGHT RIGHT now I'm feeling so TIGHT FIGHT for what you know is RIGHT Distributed Placement: Spreads rhymes evenly throughout each line: code I WRITE with MIGHT through the NIGHT My SIGHT is BRIGHT, my future's RIGHT Each FIGHT brings LIGHT to my PLIGHT These BARS are STARS burning BRIGHT Syllable Count and Rhythm Single-pattern rhyming must work within the rhythmic structure of the beat. Understanding syllable count and rhythm is essential for creating patterns that flow naturally. 4/4 Time Signature Basics: Most rap beats are in 4/4 time, with four quarter-note beats per measure. Each beat can be subdivided into smaller units: code Beat: 1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a Count: 1 2 3 4 Syllable Placement Options: On-beat: Syllables land on beats 1, 2, 3, 4 Off-beat: Syllables land on "e" and "a" subdivisions Mixed: Combination of on-beat and off-beat placement Example of Beat Alignment: code Beat: 1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a Lyrics: I write these bars with skill and might to- night Rhyme: A A A Building Rhyme Families for Single Patterns To maintain a single pattern throughout multiple lines, you need access to large families of rhyming words. This requires systematic development of your rhyme vocabulary. Exercise 4.1: Building Extended Rhyme Families Choose a core sound and build the largest possible rhyme family: Core sound: /aɪt/ (as in "night") Perfect rhymes: night, right, fight, sight, might, light, tight, bright, flight, height Family rhymes: nice, dice, price, twice, slice, spice, life, knife, wife, strife Cross-word rhymes: "I write," "my sight," "so bright," "all night" Compound rhymes: "tonight," "daylight," "spotlight," "midnight" Target: 50+ rhyming options for any core sound Maintaining Meaning While Maximizing Rhyme One of the biggest challenges in single-pattern rhyming is maintaining coherent meaning while maximizing rhyme density. Many rappers sacrifice meaning for technical display, resulting in impressive-sounding but ultimately empty verses. Strategies for Meaning Preservation: 1. Theme-First Construction: Start with your message, then find rhymes that support it: code Theme: Overcoming obstacles Core sound: /aɪt/ I fight through every dark night My sight stays focused on the light With might I'll reach that greater height Success is always worth the fight 2. Semantic Field Rhyming: Choose rhymes from related semantic fields: code Theme: Success and ambition Semantic field: Achievement, power, growth I write these bars with pure might My sight is set on greater height Each fight brings me closer to light Success burns in me so bright 3. Narrative Coherence: Ensure each line advances your story or argument: code Started from the bottom, now I'm climbing toward the light Every single obstacle just makes me want to fight My vision's getting clearer, my future's burning bright Success is in my grasp now, I can feel it in my sight Advanced Single-Pattern Techniques Once you've mastered basic single-pattern construction, you can begin incorporating advanced techniques that add sophistication without breaking the single-pattern structure. Technique 1: Pattern Variation Vary the placement and density of rhymes while maintaining the same core sound: code Line 1: I WRITE with MIGHT (2 rhymes) Line 2: Through the NIGHT my SIGHT stays BRIGHT (3 rhymes) Line 3: Every FIGHT (1 rhyme) Line 4: Brings me closer to the LIGHT of success so RIGHT (2 rhymes) Technique 2: Syllable Stretching Extend single syllables across multiple beats for emphasis: code I write these bars with mi-i-i-ight Working through the da-a-a-ay and night My flow is clean, my words are ti-i-i-ight Step to me, prepare to fi-i-i-ight Technique 3: Echo Rhyming Repeat rhyming sounds within the same line: code I write, I fight with all my might tonight My sight stays bright through every flight of fright The light, so right, ignites my inner sight Each fight, each night, brings me closer to the height Common Single-Pattern Mistakes Even experienced rappers make mistakes in single-pattern construction that weaken their verses: Mistake 1: Forced Rhymes Choosing words solely for their rhyming value without considering meaning: code Bad: I write these bars with might and sight My flow is bright like dynamite tonight (Forced and meaningless) Good: I write these bars with skill and might My flow cuts through the darkest night (Natural and meaningful) Mistake 2: Inconsistent Density Varying rhyme density randomly rather than strategically: code Bad: I WRITE these BARS with MIGHT (3 rhymes) Working through the night (1 rhyme) My
