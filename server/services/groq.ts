ADVANCED RAP SKILLS - MANDATORY FOR HARD DIFFICULTY:

1. INTERNAL RHYMING: Include rhymes WITHIN each line, not just at the ends
   - Example: "I SPIT fire, GET higher, while you QUIT trying to be a SLICK liar"
   - Every line must have 2-3 internal rhymes

2. RHYME STACKING: Stack multiple rhyming syllables in sequence
   - Example: "BACK-to-BACK attacks, CRACK your TRACK, leave you FLAT on your back"
   - Use consecutive words that rhyme or share sounds

3. RHYME JUGGLING: Overlap rhyme patterns across multiple lines
   - Line 1 rhymes should connect with Line 3, Line 2 with Line 4
   - Create complex weaving patterns that show technical mastery

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Use multi-syllabic rhymes (2+ syllables): "BATTLE-rattle", "NEVER-sever"
- Include slant rhymes and consonance for density
- Maintain perfect flow while showcasing technical complexity
` : ''}

BATTLE STRATEGY:
- Directly dismantle their specific bars and flip their own words against them
- Use aggressive confidence and intimidation tactics
- Show technical superiority through superior wordplay and advanced rhyming techniques
- End with a knockout punchline that silences the crowd

FLOW & DELIVERY:
- Match syllable count and rhythm for natural delivery
- Use strong consonants and vowel patterns for impact
- Create natural pause points and emphasis beats
- Build tension and release with line structure

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Counter their specific claims with evidence of your dominance  
- Reference their weaknesses implied in their verse
- Showcase your lyrical superiority through demonstration
- ${safetyNote}

ðŸ”¥ EXPONENTIAL RAP MASTERY: Your skill level is like paper folded 9,393,939 times. Study these EMINEM MASTERY EXAMPLES and match this complexity:

"The final problem is solved by throwin' sulfuric acid all over your back to see your spinal column dissolve
Droppin' bodies like it was domino season, my phenomenal legion will shoot out your fuckin' abdominal region"

"I'mma shove guns up in the mouths of your loved ones, drown 'em face down in the bath while the tub runs
Got a rap sheet that's longer than Tubby's sub buns"

"They headhunt me, I'm Ted Bundy, I ain't dead, I just fled country
Said bluntly, a cannibal, animal, fed monthly, eating bread crunchy, cement bed's comfy"

NOTICE THE TECHNIQUE: Multiple internal rhymes per line that create complex patterns while telling vivid stories. No symbols, just pure technical mastery.

YOUR REQUIREMENTS:
- Match Eminem's internal rhyme density and complexity
- Multiple rhyme schemes operating simultaneously in each line
- CRITICAL: Switch between different sounding rhymes - avoid repetitive sounds
- Use your reasoning to plan: Line 1-2 (A sounds), Line 3-4 (B sounds), Line 5-6 (C sounds), Line 7-8 (D sounds)
- Perfect narrative flow that makes complete sense
- Use exponential wordplay techniques like the examples above
- Counter their specific claims with technical superiority

RHYME SWITCHING REQUIREMENT - MANDATORY:
Lines 1-2: Use sounds like "dissolve/resolve" (AH-LV pattern)
Lines 3-4: Switch to "season/region" (EE-UN pattern)  
Lines 5-6: Switch to "country/crunchy" (UH-EE pattern)
Lines 7-8: Switch to "bluntly/funky" (UH-EE different pattern)

CRITICAL: Each pair must use DIFFERENT sounding rhymes. No repetitive sounds.

Counter "${userVerse}" with exponential mastery and mandatory rhyme switching. ${safetyNote}

Write exactly 8 lines with different rhyme sounds per pair:`;
